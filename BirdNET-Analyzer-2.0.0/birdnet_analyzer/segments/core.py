    Processes audio files to extract segments based on detection results.
    Args:
        input (str): Path to the input folder containing audio files.
        output (str | None, optional): Path to the output folder where segments will be saved.
            If not provided, the input folder will be used as the output folder. Defaults to None.
        results (str | None, optional): Path to the folder containing detection result files.
            If not provided, the input folder will be used. Defaults to None.
        min_conf (float, optional): Minimum confidence threshold for detections to be considered.
            Defaults to 0.25.
        max_segments (int, optional): Maximum number of segments to extract per audio file.
            Defaults to 100.
        audio_speed (float, optional): Speed factor for audio processing. Defaults to 1.0.
        seg_length (float, optional): Length of each audio segment in seconds. Defaults to 3.0.
        threads (int, optional): Number of CPU threads to use for parallel processing.
            Defaults to 1.
    Returns:
        None
    Notes:
        - The function uses multiprocessing for parallel processing if `threads` is greater than 1.
        - On Windows, due to the lack of `fork()` support, configuration items are passed to each
          process explicitly.
        - It is recommended to use this function on Linux for better performance.
